This script contains the functions required for the calculation of the unbiased areas of map classes when the samples were produced using the strata of a different map:

	1. Function to calculate strata for any given pair of years
	2. Calculate unbiased area proportions and variance of reference classes
	3. Calculate standard error of unbiased area proportion
	4. Calculate unbiased areas, their confidence interval and margin of error

The functions in this script are based on Stehman S. V. 2014. Estimating area and map accuracy for stratified random sampling when the strata are different from the map classes. Int. J. Remote Sens. 35: 4923-4939.
